This extension contains currently:

- two new fields for the Inventory Movement Table (M_Movement) to allow setting
  the source and destination warehouse for the movement. When these are set
  there is a new callout in this extension that sets the source and destination
  locator automatically by searching for in the specified warehouses.
  
For this Extension to work properly you'll have to change the callouts in the
M_MovementLine Table like this:

- remove the callout on the M_Product_ID Field (as we already provide a new
  callout for this one)
- add a callout to the M_Locator Field
  (org.compiere.model.CalloutMovement.locator)
